# Markov Equivalence

## Requirements
* Python3

## How to run

To run this code, you must import the class MarkovEquivalenceChecker and instantiate an object passing the path of the files containing the Adjacency Matrices of the two desired graphs (To see an example, check the two .txt files contained in this repository.). Then, you should just call the method are_markov_equivalent() and the program will answer it with a boolean.
